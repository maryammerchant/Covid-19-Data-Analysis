# Covid-19-Data-Analysis

I have taken covid-19 data and started working on that dataset. It’s fun to explore the data. Remember, the dataset is not perfect but we can improve it by analyzing and processing it to get our answers.

You can download the covid-data set from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. 

When you open the link, you will see the below image.Just click on the “Download” option located at the bottom right. You will get a CSV file till today’s date of covid data.

Remember: My analysis will be different than yours, as you will download dataset till today's date. I downloaded it much before.
